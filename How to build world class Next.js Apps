Chapter 1: Getting Started

To get started with Next.js, you will need to install the Next.js library and create a new project using the Next.js CLI or a tool such as Create Next App.
Next.js uses a file-system based routing system, where each file in the pages directory represents a route. To create a new page, simply create a new file in the pages directory.
Next.js supports automatic code splitting, which means that your application will only load the code that is needed for each page, improving performance and reducing the initial load time.

Chapter 2: Fetching Data

Next.js provides a getStaticProps and a getServerSideProps function that allow you to fetch data at build time or on the server for each request, respectively.
To fetch data at build time, you can use the getStaticProps function inside a page component. This function takes a context object as an argument and returns an object with the props that will be passed to the component.
To fetch data on the server for each request, you can use the getServerSideProps function inside a page component. This function takes a context object as an argument and returns an object with the props that will be passed to the component.

Chapter 3: Real-Time Applications

Next.js comes with built-in support for Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSockets, making it easy to build real-time applications.
To use SSE in your Next.js app, you can use the EventSource API on the client and the sse middleware on the server.
To use WebSockets in your Next.js app, you can use the WebSocket API on the client and the ws middleware on the server.

Chapter 4: Deployment

Next.js has built-in support for optimized production builds and serverless functions, making it easy to deploy your application to a hosting provider or a serverless environment.
To deploy your Next.js app to a hosting provider, you can use the next build and next export commands to create a production-ready build of your app, and then upload the resulting files to your hosting provider.
To deploy your Next.js app as a serverless function, you can use tools such as Zeit Now or AWS Lambda to host your app as a function.
